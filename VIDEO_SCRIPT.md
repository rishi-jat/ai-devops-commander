## 🎬 VIDEO STRUCTURE

### INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)
```
"Hey everyone! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm presenting AI DevOps Commander - 
an autonomous AI system that monitors deployments and makes real-time 
rollback decisions.

A huge thank you to WeMake Devs, Kunal Kushwaha, 
for organizing this amazing hackathon. This has been an incredible 
learning experience!"

### THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:00)
```
"So what problem are we solving?

In production environments, when you deploy new code, things can go wrong:
- Error rates spike
- Memory leaks happen  
- Response times degrade

Traditional monitoring requires engineers to manually check dashboards,
analyze metrics, and decide whether to rollback. This takes TIME.

What if AI could do this automatically? That's what I built."
```

### THE SOLUTION (1:00 - 2:00)
```
"AI DevOps Commander is a fully autonomous deployment guardian.

Here's how it works:
1. When a deployment happens, Kestra triggers a workflow
2. The system collects real metrics - error rate, memory, response time
3. Together AI analyzes these metrics using an LLM
4. The AI decides: CONTINUE or ROLLBACK
5. If rollback needed, Cline automation kicks in

All of this happens WITHOUT human intervention."
```

### TECH STACK (2:00 - 2:30)
```
"Let me show you the tech stack:

- KESTRA: The orchestration engine - manages the entire workflow
- TOGETHER AI: Powers the LLM for intelligent decision making
- OUMI: For reinforcement learning and model training
- CLINE: Automated remediation when rollback is needed
- CODERABBIT: AI code review for the codebase
- VERCEL: Hosting the dashboard you're about to see
- NEXT.JS: The dashboard frontend"
